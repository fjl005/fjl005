## Hi, I'm Frank Lee.
### And "Frankly," I've never heard my name punned before! /s

During high school, I discovered that creating a simple Pong game with [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) was the funnest homework assignment I had ever done. Only having "scratched" a tiny surface of the gigantic computer science iceberg, I knew that I wanted to further pursue this subject. But instead, when I had applied to colleges, I trusted my father's wisdom in pursuing medicine, as he strongly discouraged the engineering path in light of his personal struggles. 

As I progressed down the medical route, however, I realized that the doctor pursuit was my father's dream, not my own. So having a Masters in Biology, I pivoted into the next best thing, cancer research, but only for it to leave me unfulfilled once again. After deeply reflecting what I truly wanted for myself, I decided, in a bold act of defiance against people's expectations, to pursue my own dream. Thus, I enrolled in Nucamp's Full Stack Bootcamp, and the rest is history (documented on my Github).
