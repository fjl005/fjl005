## Hi, I'm Frank Lee.
### And "Frankly," I've never heard my name punned before! /s

During my high school Java class, I discovered that creating a simple Pong game with [MIT's Scratch language](https://scratch.mit.edu/) was the funnest homework assignment I had ever done. Although I had only scratched (aha!) a miniscule surface of the gigantic iceberg comprising computer science, I knew that I wanted to pursue this subject. But instead, when I had applied to colleges, I trusted my father's wisdom in pursuing medicine, as he strongly discouraged the engineering path in light of his personal struggles. So I gave it a shot. 

As I progressed down the medical route, however, I realized that the doctor pursuit was my father's dream, not my own. So having a Masters in Biology, I pivoted into the next best thing, cancer research, but only for it to leave me unfulfilled once again. At a seeming career dead end, I took a moment to deeply reflect on my aspirations. What did I truly want? What was my genuine passion? It was during this introspection that I was reminded of the sheer joy that came from the funnest homework assignment, the thrill of programming. In a bold act of defiance against others' expectations, especially those of my father, I made the decision to pursue my own dream. I enrolled in Nucamp's Full Stack Bootcamp, determined to carve out a career path that aligned with my true passions and aspirations.

My web development pursuit been a fun journey filled with exhillerating joys of functioning code paired with the inevitable React errors that dramatically flood the entire page. As you browse through [my portfolio](https://www.frankleedev.com) and my projects, I hope you may see me as a potential fit for your company. If that's the case, then please reach out as I'd love to connect!
